The purpose of this project is to build a small 2D video game using MiniLibX and learn a bit about how a simple video game usually works

**Overview**

In short, you'll have to create a simple 2D game, top-down or viewed from the side.
The subject in itself is fairly clear on what you have to do.
First off all you should understand the minilibx. MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa. 
It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system.
