**Overview**

The 42 So_Long project is an exciting challenge where you build a 2D game using the MinilibX library, a lightweight graphics library provided by 42. In this game, players explore a map, collect items, and navigate around obstacles to reach the final destination.

**Goal**

The main goal of the So_Long project is to create a fully functional 2D game that incorporates essential game mechanics. These include rendering the map, handling player movement, detecting collisions, collecting items, and managing win/lose conditions. Completing this project will sharpen your game development abilities and deepen your understanding of the MinilibX library.
