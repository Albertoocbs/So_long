The purpose of this project is to build a small 2D video game using MiniLibX and learn a bit about how a simple video game usually works

-------

**Status**

Finished: 2025-02-15. Grade: 100/100.

------- 

**Overview**

The 42 So_Long project is an exciting challenge where you build a 2D game using the MinilibX library, a lightweight graphics library provided by 42. In this game, players explore a map, collect items, and navigate around obstacles to reach the final destination.

**Goal**

The main goal of the So_Long project is to create a fully functional 2D game that incorporates essential game mechanics. These include rendering the map, handling player movement, detecting collisions, collecting items, and managing win/lose conditions. Completing this project will sharpen your game development abilities and deepen your understanding of the MinilibX library.

------

Prior to starting with this project, itâ€™s recomended to learn about the miniLibX, the simple graphic library that we use at 42. Take a look in this page to get an overview: https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/miniLibX_sample](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/loops.html)

**Recommendation**

Before diving into the code, I highly recommend trying to implement the game mechanics yourself. Take the time to understand all the concepts, functions, and libraries involved in the project. Exploring the code can be helpful, but ensuring you grasp the fundamentals will provide a stronger learning experience and make troubleshooting easier. Remember, the journey of understanding is just as important as the final result!
